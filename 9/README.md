# Project 9: Jack Programs

This directory contains a collection of applications written in the Jack programming language.

> **⚠️ Disclaimer**: All classes and programs were tested on the **Nand2Tetris Online IDE** using the **Fastest** speed setting. Running these programs at slower speeds (e.g., "Fast" or "Slow") may result in glitchy animations or unexpected behavior due to the use of `Sys.wait()` calls for timing.

## Custom Projects
These projects were implemented as additional extensions and practice:

*   **Flappybird**: A full implementation of the Flappy Bird game. Features a custom bird sprite, gravity physics, pipe generation, and collision detection.
*   **DVD**: A graphical simulation of the bouncing DVD logo screensaver.
*   **complex_num**: A library for handling complex numbers.
*   **string reverse**: A utility to reverse text strings.
*   **sum**: Calculates the sum of a sequence of numbers.
*   **hellonew**: A variation of the basic hello world program.

## Standard Course Projects
These are the standard projects provided by the Nand2Tetris course:

### Games & Interactive
*   **Pong**: The classic paddle and ball game.
*   **Square**: A simple interactive demo allowing the user to move a square on screen.

### Data Structures & Math
*   **Fraction**: A class for performing arithmetic operations with fractions.
*   **List**: An implementation of a Linked List data structure.
*   **ConvertToBin**: Converts integer values to their binary string representation.
*   **Average**: Calculates the average of a sequence of numbers.
*   **ComplexArrays**: Demonstrates more advanced array manipulation techniques.

### Basic Examples
*   **HelloWorld**: The standard introductory program.
